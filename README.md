House Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a highly professional and practice-oriented approach to predicting house prices using multiple features such as square footage, location, and condition. The goal is to apply advanced machine learning techniques to build a highly optimized and interpretable regression model capable of delivering precise and reliable predictions, ready for real-world applications.

Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust, efficient, and highly optimized machine learning pipeline for house price prediction. Key focuses include:
	•	Data Quality & Preprocessing: Ensuring that the data is clean, well-processed, and suitable for modeling, addressing issues like missing values, categorical variables, and scaling.
	•	Model Performance Optimization: The project employs state-of-the-art algorithms like XGBoost and TensorFlow-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to ensure the best model selection through rigorous comparisons, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
	•	Interpretability & Explainability: The project incorporates techniques like feature importance visualization to not only deliver predictions but also explain the rationale behind those predictions, making the model transparent and interpretable for real-world use.
	•	Production-Ready Code: The entire pipeline is structured and documented to meet the highest standards, ensuring that the code can be easily deployed and maintained in production environments.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from the widely recognized Kaggle House Prices Competition. It contains various features of houses and their sale prices, which are used to train and evaluate the models.
	•	train.csv: The training data, including house features and sale prices.
	•	test.csv: The test data, containing house features without sale prices.

Both CSV files should be placed in the /data directory.

Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have a virtual environment set up and install the required dependencies.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
	•	Create the virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


	•	Activate the virtual environment (Windows):

venv\Scripts\activate


	•	Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux):

source venv/bin/activate



2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run

The entire machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization — can be executed using the main.py file. Simply run:

python main.py

This will trigger the full process, from raw data processing and model training to the evaluation and visualizations of the model’s performance.
